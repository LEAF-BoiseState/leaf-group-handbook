### Slack

The LEAF group maintains a Slack team for all members to communicate. Slack is a messaging platform used for both synchronous and asynchronous communications. Slack messages can be both posted to feeds and channels visible by many or all members of the team, or sent as direct messages to individual members. Slack messages can be formatted to demonstrate, for instance, that a message contains code or pseudocode, can link to websites or external files, or can contain files or images. Messages tend to be more brief and less formal than email communications. Channels on the Slack team (denoted by beginning with a hash symbol '#') are a useful way of organizing communications on specific topics. For example, a Slack channel might relate to a specific project, topic, modeling platform. Channels are not meant to exclude group members from participating in communication threads, but rather to prevent their Slack feeds from being inundated with messages that are not relevant. Slack channels are not visible to everyone in the Slack Team by default. If you create a new channel, make an announcement in the `#general` channel indicating you've created one as an invitation for others to participate.
