## Best Practices for Version Control

* Dedicate time to learning how to use version control software and platforms. Git and GitHub are the ones we use in the LEAF group.

* Take advantage of workshops, short courses, and/or hackathons where you can learn about advanced topics. 

## Documentation

All GitHub repositories should have README files.
