# Authoring Publications




You should be familiar with recently published material relevant to your PhD project. Below are some academic journals that may be of interest:

Water Resources Research, Hydrologic Processes, Journal of Hydrology, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, Geoscientific Model Development, Biogeosciences, Remote Sensing of Environment, Geophysical Research Letters, Environmental Research Letters, Frontiers in Earth Science, Hydrometeorology, Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmosphere, Journal of Geophysical Research-Surface, Earth’s Future, Environmental Modelling and Software, Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems, etc.

Signing-up to ‘mail alerts’ from specific journals and more general publication ‘feeds’ (e.g. Google Scholar) are highly recommended; by doing this, you can be kept informed of newly published literature related to your studies.
