# Data Management

Effective management of research data is critical to the LEAF group. 

## Planning to Manage Your Data

As part of your thesis or dissertation proposal (and ideally earlier) you will need to develop a plan articulating how you will manage your research data. This data management plan (DMP)

The following questions are essential to developing an effective data management plan:
1. What kinds of data will you be creating and using? 
2. How will you document the data that you are creating and using? 
3. Who should have access to your data during your research project?
4. How will you make your data available and usable after your project is over? 

If your project is supported by a grant or contract, there may already be a DMP that was developed during the project proposal phase. 

In either way, you should ask Lejo for an example
