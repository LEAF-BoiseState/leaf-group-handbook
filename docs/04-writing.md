# Writing

 For some (like Lejo) writing is the most challenging part of the research process. It is also the most important; no one will know how amazing your research is if you can't communicate it effectively! Writing is a craft and perishable skill, meaning that it improves with work and can atrophy when not used. I __*highly*__ recommend that to improve your writing skills you: (1) write early and often, (2) solicit feedback on your writing, and (3) don't go it alone.    

## Write Early and Often

The good news is that opportunities to practice your writing are abundant and it is __*never*__ too early to begin writing your thesis or dissertation. Take note of when you are writing and recognize that all writing, whether compulsory or voluntary, provides opportunity to practice and hone your skills. Email, class problem sets and projects, or project reports all represent relatively low stakes opportunities to practice a skill you find difficult or try a new one. 

Seek out opportunities to write more. This can take the form of writing for general reading   

## Solicit Feedback and Get Help

## Writing in Groups

Making writing a social activity can add a small bit of helpful peer pressure to promote frequent writing. 

On an individual basis, you might find a colleague who can be a writing buddy (accountability partner). You and your partner will set aside a short, regular period (one hour for one day each week is good) when you meet and do nothing but write. Often partner writing sessions begin with a brief overview of what you're working on and what your goal for the session is. To minimize distractions, a common technique is to sit back-to-back so that you can periodically glance over your shoulder to make sure your partner is writing. You can choose to write by hand with pen and paper to eliminate the temptation of the screen.

Similarly, it may be helpful to write in a small group. Often referred to as writing circles, these group writing sessions work similar to one-on-one writing sessions. A writing session might be scheduled for 60-90 minutes one day each week and begin with a short overview of everyone's goals for the session. To incentivize continued attendance, sometimes writing circles engage in a social outing after they conclude. For instance, a writing circle might be scheduled from 11 am until noon, after which attendees go to lunch. More sophisticated versions of writing circles might devote a portion of the writing session to writing, and then exchange writing with colleagues for rapid feedback. 

Lejo would be happy to help arrange a writing circle for group members and other students. The lab is always available for writing circles and we can use signage to indicate writing sessions are in progress.
