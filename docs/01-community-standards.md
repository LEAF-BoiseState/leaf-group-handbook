# Community Standards

This part of the handbook outlines general standards and practices that constitute being a good member of the LEAF and university community. Adhering to these community standards not only helps foster an open and inclusive research environment, but also shows leadership and sets a standard for others in our community.

### Graduate Advisor 

### Graduate Supervisory Committee

Your relationship with your graduate supervisory committee is exceptionally important and, when adequately nurtured, one of the biggest gifts you can receive as a graduate student.  

You should arrange committee meetings so that they occur on a regular basis -- __*at least*__ once per semester. It is important for you to take initiative in scheduling these meetings. Finding time to meet with the entire supervisory committee is often difficult because members are exceptionally busy. Send a scheduling poll (see Resources section below) far enough ahead to schedule, kindly remind committee members to indicate their availability, and send a calendar invite to all members to hold the time. It is not uncommon to need to schedule a committee meeting 1-2 __*months*__ ahead of time! 

Update your formal mentors (particularly your graduate supervisory committee) on a regular basis
