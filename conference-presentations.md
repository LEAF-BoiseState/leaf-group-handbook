# Conference Presentations

Attending conferences and workshops to present work is simultaneously a responsibility of being a group member, an opportunity to develop as a professional and researcher, and a privilege acquired through hard work 

Generally speaking, we attend conferences and workshops to:
* Share the research activities and results 
* Learn what research 
* Develop professional
* Meet to coordinate with 

Which conferences and workshops you attend will largely depend on potential requirements of your research project, your professional development needs and goals, the availability of funds to support conference travel.
