# Conference Presentations

Attending conferences and workshops to present work is simultaneously a responsibility of being a group member, an opportunity to develop as a professional and researcher, and a privilege acquired through hard work and commitment to your research projects. 

Generally speaking, we attend conferences and workshops for several reasons:
* Share our research activities and results with other members of the scholarly community 
* Learn what research is being carried out elsewhere in the community
* Develop professional skills and relationships
* Meet to develop new collaborations and coordinate with existing collaborators on specific projects 

Which conferences and workshops you attend will largely depend on potential requirements of your research project, your professional development needs and goals, the availability of funds to support conference travel.
